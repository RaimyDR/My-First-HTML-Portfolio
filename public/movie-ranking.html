<h1>Best Animes according to Raimy</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Animes of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite animes since the story is really entertaining<br />
and the animation way spectacular. It's about strong demons and demon slayers.</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>  

<p>Very similar to the last one, however, this one is about Sorcerers and<br />
Cursed Spirits, fights and story are really entertaining</p> 

<h3>Berserk</h3>

<p>Extremely good story, about a mercenary that likes to figth strong guys<br />
and after some time begins to encounter with demons and paranormal entities</p>
